# FUSE-Internship-2024

This will mostly be used to play around with PyBAMM and get some models running!

The 'PyBaMM training.ipynb' is my initial training of the PyBaMM package, following [Intro to PyBaMM](https://train.oxrse.uk/material/HPCu/libraries/pybamm).

The 'Rheological and flow analysis model.ipynb' is where I modelled some different Newtionian and Non-newtionian fluid proerties using PyBAMM and

The supervisors for the project are Ferran Brosa Planella and Jabbari Masoud.
